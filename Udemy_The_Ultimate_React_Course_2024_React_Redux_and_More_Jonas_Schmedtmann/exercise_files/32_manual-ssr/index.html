		<!-- The attribute type="text/babel" in the <script> tag is used to specify that the script file is written in JSX (JavaScript XML) and needs to be transpiled by Babel on the client-side. -->
		<!-- Using Babel in the browser (text/babel) is generally discouraged for production environments because transpiling on the client-side can slow down page load times. It's primarily used in development or for learning purposes. In production environments, you'd typically use a build tool like Webpack to precompile your JSX and ES6+ code to standard JavaScript before deployment. This avoids runtime transpilation overhead. -->
