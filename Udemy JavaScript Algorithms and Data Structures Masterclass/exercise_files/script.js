//LESSON 2 - BIG O NOTATION

// NOTE BIG-O NOTATION IS USED TO ANALYZE THE PERFORMANCE OF AN ALGORITHM. BIG-O NOTATION GIVES US A HIGH LEVEL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TIME OR SPACE COMPLEXITY OF AN ALGORITHM.

function addUpTo1(n) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    total += i;

//->TIME COMPLEXITY
// Instead of counting seconds whic vary even for the same task repetitevly on the same machine with no changes, one might chose to count the number of simple operations that the computer has to perform.
/** NOTES
 * 1. ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS ARE CONSTANT TIME
 * 2. VARIABLE ASSIGNMENTS ARE CONSTANT TIME
 * 3. ACCESSIGN ELEMENTS IN AN ARRAY VIA INDEX OR OBJECTS VIA KEYS ARE CONSTANT TIME
 * 4. LOOPS ARE N COMPLEXITY TIME
 * 5. CASCADED LOOPS ARE N * WHATEVER INNER LOOPS COMPLEXITY TIME
 * **/
//->SPACE COMPLEXITY
// Auxillary space complexity is the space required by the algorithm, exclusive of the space taken up by the inputs.
/** NOTES
 * 1. BOOLEANS, NMUMBERS,UNDEFINMED,NULL ARE CONSTANT SPACE
 * 2. STRINGS REQUIRE O(N) SPACE
 * 3. REFERENCE TYPES LIKE ELEMENTS IN AN ARRAY VIA INDEX OR OBJECTS VIA KEYS REQUIRE O(N) SPACE
